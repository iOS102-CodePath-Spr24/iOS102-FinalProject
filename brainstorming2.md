## Group 8 Project Ideas

### Idea 1: Spotify Clone
- What: Clone of the Spotify app
- Who: Users who like listening to music
- Why: We all use Spotify and want to see if we can recreate the features of the app
- Challenges: Figuring out what limitations the Spotify API has, and which features we can actually implement. Some might be limited due to Copyright and pay wall stuff.

### Idea 2: Recipe Tracker
- What: Users can keep a list of recipes and list details for them such as ingredients and directions.
- Who: Everybody, since most people cook at least some.
- Why: Allows users to be more organized and motivated to cook more.
- Challenges: Figuring out what features could make this app unique and stand out.

### Idea 3: Movies App
- What: App to see movies that are currently playing.
- Who: Everybody since most people would be interested in seeing what movies are out.
- Why: Would allow users to be up to date with current playing movies and would be able to view details about them.
- Challenges: Since we did a similar examples in class, would need to find a lot of extra features to make it stand out.

### Idea 4: Pickup Sports Social Media
- What: App that allows people to connect so that they can meet up to play pickup sports.
- Who: People who want to find a group to play sports with.
- Why: It can be challenging to find people who want to play the same sport as you, or to find enough people to play a sport that takes a lot of people.
- Challenges: Would need to implement many features since there are so many differnt types of sports available. Would need to decide how specific to make the experience per each sport.

### Idea 5: Game App
- What: Some type of game like a version of trivia or some type of board game.
- Who: Anybody who likes the game and wants to play it.
- Why: It would be a fun challenge to implement all the rules, plus users enjoy playing games digitally these days.
- Challenges: Would need to find a game that would fit the scope of the topics we need to implement, and would be suitable to be done on an iPhone.
